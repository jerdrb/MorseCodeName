# Summary
This project is part of my Master's degree course work in Human-Computer Interaction. During this work, we were tasked to consider Don Norman's philosophy on designs and create a
UI feature that is unintuitive or convoluted. My entry to this idea is a poor man's CW input, AKA Morse Code.

## How to use
Utilizing the Morse Code standard, a user can input each letter into the system, then submit it to be parsed and provide the resulting outcome. Should the user like to restart, or
remove any errors, a clear button has been provided.
